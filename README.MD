# Tally Snap Ins
What is this?
- I originally created Tally for Atlas, but as time rolled by I wanted to use this for multiple things such as SkyBlock, PGM, and even normal survival.
- I realized that forking this every time to make a new plugin for new purposes isn't good so I made snap ins.
- I put together all the changes to tally I made into one place.
